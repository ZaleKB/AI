To Run the program

Jun Run the Code, Since I combined each class in one file and only have one main function.

Notice inside main(), 
I create GeometryMap object mapToShow

I create map2d object mapTest

I create AStar object aStar

I create draw object pathMap

four objects

you can use them to access all method they include and attribute they have.

Please run it first and you don't need to care about the order its been called.
